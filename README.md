I have crated a folder in local path /d/Learning/Month 1/day 2
 I ran below mentioned command as part of day 3 activity 

 git config --list
 git init
 git status
 
 git add .
 git commit -m "first commit in this branch "
 git remote add origin https://github.com/Ironman143000/github-action-learn.git
 git pull --rebase origin main
 git push -u origin main
